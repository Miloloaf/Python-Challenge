## Problem 10 http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/return/bull.html
# len(a[30]) = ?

# 1,11,21,1211,11121

# If a number is singular n, new number = 1 + n
# If number is consecutive n, append consectuve number * value, ie n(value) not this is not the size but the number of times n returns.

#So the above boils down to how many times the digit occurs conssecutively

number = "112"
for i in range(29): #How many times the program should run n-1
    new_number=""
    for j in range(len(number)): #Returns the next number in the lsit
        digit = number[j]
        if j == 0:
            print(number[j],j)
        elif number[j] != number[j-1]:
            new_number +=
        elif number[j] == number[j-1]:
            print(number[j],j)

        else:
            print ("Gotch ya",j)

    print ()
