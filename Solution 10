## Problem 10 http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/return/bull.html
# len(a[30]) = ?

# 1,11,21,1211,11121

# If a number is singular n, new number = 1 + n
# If number is consecutive n, append consectuve number * value, ie n(value) not this is not the size but the number of times n returns.

#So the above boils down to how many times the digit occurs conssecutively

import re

number = "1"
for n in range(30):
    number = "".join([str(len(i+j))+i for i,j in re.findall(r"(\d)(\1*)", number)])

print(number)
print(len(number))
